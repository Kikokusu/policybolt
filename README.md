## 🔄 n8n Automation Workflows

PolicyBolt uses three main n8n workflows to handle AI-powered policy generation and GitHub integration. These workflows are stored in the `n8n/` folder:

### **`policy_scan.json`**
Monitors GitHub repositories for changes and triggers policy updates when new commits are detected. This workflow:
- Receives webhook notifications from GitHub
- Fetches project data from Supabase
- Compares commit IDs to detect new changes
- Triggers the repository scanning workflow when changes are found

### **`policy_generation.json`**
Handles the core AI-powered privacy policy generation process. This workflow:
- Analyzes repository code and project configuration
- Integrates with OpenAI GPT-4o for intelligent policy generation
- Creates comprehensive privacy policies based on detected data patterns
- Stores generated policies in Supabase with pending review status

### **`github_repo_scan.json`**
Performs deep analysis of GitHub repositories to identify privacy-relevant code patterns. This workflow:
- Scans repository files for API integrations and third-party services
- Detects data collection patterns and user tracking implementations
- Identifies compliance requirements based on geographic targeting
- Feeds analysis results to the policy generation workflow

These workflows work together to provide seamless, automated privacy policy management that keeps pace with your development workflow.

- For Supabase Edge Functions, configure `RESEND_API_KEY`, `FROM_EMAIL`, and `TO_EMAILS` in your Supabase project's Edge Functions environment variables
- For Stripe integration, configure `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in your Supabase project's Edge Functions environment variables
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your actual values for local development

## 🚀 Deployment

The application is ready for deployment to any static hosting provider such as Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms. Build with `npm run build` and deploy the `dist` folder.
